Site description:
    Proxy Slots sells "slots." Each slot allows you to learn the IP address and port of exactly one PUBLIC proxy.
    Users may purchase one or more slots. If a proxy is detected as "dead" (unreachable via TCP), then we provide information about another that is reachable.

    The site provides no other service to users than giving information about proxies. In short, our business is checking the status of proxies and then feeding
    them to users. We DO NOT host proxy servers.

Site login information:
    username: "pay"
    password: "pal"

    * This login will be usable in about an hour or so, I have to code in logic to let you in.
    * Preferably, sign in with a Google account. The price is $0.75/proxy information.
